# Cake.Sdk Example Repository

This repository demonstrates minimal, modern usage of [Cake.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Sdk/) for .NET build automation. It showcases file-based, multi-file-based, and project-based approaches for defining Cake build scripts, and includes a minimal .NET class library.

## Features

- **File-based build script**: Standalone `cake.cs` using Cake Sdk directives.
- **Multi-file-based build script**: `multifile-build/cake.cs` with additional files in build folder.
- **Advanced multi-file-based build script**: `multifile-build-advanced/cake.cs` with organized structure, dependency injection, and service patterns.
- **Project-based build script**: `build/build.csproj` referencing Cake.Sdk.
- **Pinned versions**: .NET SDK and Cake.Sdk versions are pinned via `global.json`.
- **CI examples**: Example GitHub Actions workflows for all approaches.

## Usage

- **File-based build**:  
  Run with:  
  ```sh
  dotnet cake cake.cs
  ```
- **Project-based build**:
  Run with:  
  ```sh
  dotnet run --project build/build.csproj
  ```
- **Multi-file-based build**:
  Run with:
  ```sh
  dotnet cake multifile-build/cake.cs
  ```
- **Advanced multi-file-based build**:
  Run with:
  ```sh
  dotnet cake multifile-build-advanced/cake.cs
  ```

## Continuous Integration

- **.github/workflows/CakeFile.yml**: Runs the file-based build script on push/PR.
- **.github/workflows/CakeProj.yml**: Runs the project-based build script on push/PR.
- **.github/workflows/Cake_Sdk-MultiFile.yml**: Runs the multi-file-based build script on push/PR.
- **.github/workflows/Cake_Sdk-MultiFile-Advanced.yml**: Runs the advanced multi-file-based build script on push/PR.

All workflows use the pinned .NET SDK and Cake.Sdk versions from `global.json`.

## About Cake.Sdk

[Cake.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Sdk/) is a custom SDK for Cake build automation, providing:
- Minimal project configuration
- Optimized build settings
- Built-in source generation (via Cake.Generator)
- Automatic inclusion of Cake.Core, Cake.Common, and Cake.Cli

**Requirements:** .NET 8.0 or later
